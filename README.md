# FYS-STK4155
This repository contains projects completed for the course FYS-STK4155 (Applied data analysis and machine learning) at the university of Oslo. Collaborators on the projects are Martine Tan, Aram Salihi, and Andras Philip Playan.

## List of projects

* **Project 1:** Using Linear, Ridge, and Lasso regression to analyze terrain data. Terrain data can be downloaded from https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/.
* **Project 2:** In this project we developed our own implementation of logistic regression and feed-forward neural networks, and used these to analyze the Wisconsin breat cancer data set (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(original)).
* **Project 3:** Comparing Convoluted Neural Networks (CNN) with ordinary Logistic Regression for classifying images of cats and dogs. The cats and dogs dataset can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data. We used Tenforflow to build CNNs in this project.
