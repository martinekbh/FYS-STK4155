# FYS-STK4155
This repository contains projects completed for the course FYS-STK4155 (Applied data analysis and machine learning) at the university of Oslo. Collaborators on the projects are Martine Tan, Aram Salihi, and Andras Philip Playan.

## List of projects

* **Project 1:** In this project we used Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso to analyze terrain data. Terrain data can be downloaded from https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/.

* **Project 2:** In this project we developed our own implementation of Logistic Regression and Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFNN), and used these to analyze the Wisconsin breat cancer data set (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(original)). The goal was to compare the performance of logistic regression and FFNNs in analyzing the data.

* **Project 3:** Comparing Convoluted Neural Networks (CNN) with ordinary Logistic Regression for classifying images of cats and dogs. The cats and dogs dataset can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data. We used Tenforflow to build CNNs in this project.
