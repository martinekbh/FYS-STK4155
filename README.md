# FYS-STK4155
This repository contains projects completed for the course FYS-STK4155 (Applied data analysis and machine learning) at the university of Oslo. Collaborators on the projects are Martine Tan, Aram Salihi, and Andras Philip Playan.

## List of projects

* **Project 1:** In this project we implemented algorithms for Linear Regression, Ridge Regression and Lasso (using python), and compared how well these regression methods were able to model Franke's function and digital terrain data from https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/. 

Excerpt from the introduction of the [project report](https://github.com/martinekbh/FYS-STK4155/blob/master/project1/article/fys_stk_project1.pdf): *The aim of this numerical study is to experiment with three different regression methods in detail: Linear regression, ridge regression, and lasso regression. In addition, cross validation will be used as a resampling technique to further evaluate the regression methods. The project largely consists of two parts. The first part comprises of implementing the regression methods and relevant algorithms in python. We will use Franke's function to generate a data set upon which we can apply and test our code during the developing process. We will also discuss in detail the bias-variance trade-off in the regression methods. In the second part of the our numerical study, we will apply this code to digital terrain data from USGS. Digital terrain data can be downloaded from https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/.* 

* **Project 2:** In this project we developed our own implementation of Logistic Regression and Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFNN), and used these to analyze the Wisconsin breat cancer data set (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(original)). The goal was to compare the performance of logistic regression and FFNNs in analyzing the data.

* **Project 3:** Comparing Convoluted Neural Networks (CNN) with ordinary Logistic Regression for classifying images of cats and dogs. The cats and dogs dataset can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data. We used Tenforflow to build CNNs in this project.
